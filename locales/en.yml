  hero_title: "Alejandra Azuero-Quijano is an anthropologist, legal scholar, and writer."
  book_blurb_1: "In <em>The Strike as Theory: History of the Present and ‘Estallido’ in Colombia</em> Alejandra Azuero-Quijano invites us to conceptualize the 2021 national strike that swept Colombia as an “estallido or “epistemic outbreak”, an event that articulates national history to time-rhythms that allow us to rethink the past to imagine and actualize what is possible in the present. Through her analysis of popular repertoires of resistance and interruption, Azuero-Quijano shows how the national strike reorganized the coordinates through which Colombian politics is understood, imagined, perceived and represented and, by extension, the political and social reality of Latin America and the Caribbean."
  book_blurb_2: "The strike, which began in April 2021 as a reaction against the controversial tax reform promoted by the government in the midst of the pandemic, ended that same year. Yet, as Azuero-Quijano argues, although the protesters are no longer on the street, the historical force of the strike exceeded its duration as an event, launching forms of aesthetic, political, and sense experimentation that are still ongoing."
  book_blurb_3: "<em>The Strike as Theory</em> invites us to dwell on the uprising as an event with the potential to change everything: from our politics to our ways of knowing and sensing, as well as our philosophy of history."
